Description: Toolbox for carrying out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a general linear model (GLM). In addition to carrying out GWAs using GLM, GLM2020 includes functions for carrying out pre-processing of cofactors prior to conducting GWAS by GLM, including the calculation of principal components (PCs) from genotypic data to assess population structure. Specifically, the package provides functionality for identifying correlations between genotypic PCs and cofactors specified by users, as well as automatically removing those PCs that exhibit correlation. A vignette using simulated data is provided to depict package functionality.
