#' A tool for implementing genome-wide association analysis using a general linear model.
#'
#' @description This package offers several features for efficiently carrying out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using general linear models (GLM). Users may input phenotypic and genotypic data, as well as user-specified cofactors (e.g., location collected) and principal components calculated from genotype data.
#' In addition to implementing GWAS using a GLM, this package offers functionality for automatically removing genotypic principal components that exhibit correlation with user-specified cofactors.
